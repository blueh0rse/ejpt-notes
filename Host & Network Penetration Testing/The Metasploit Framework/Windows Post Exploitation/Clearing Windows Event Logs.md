# Clearing Windows Event Logs

- Windows stores and catalogs all actions/events performed on the system and stores them in the Windows Event log
- Event logs are categorized based on the type they store:
	- Application logs, store application events like startup, crash...
	- System logs, store system events like startup, reboot...
	- Security logs store security events like passwords changes, authentication failures...
- Event logs can be accessed via the Event Viewer on Windows
- Events logs are first stop for any forensic investigator after a compromise has been detected

## Demonstration

```bash
# get a meterpreter session first
# with admin privs
m> clearev
# now all logs are cleared
```
