# Pivoting

- Pivoting is a post exploitation technique that involves utilizing a compromised host to attack other systems on the compromised host's private network
- After gaining access to one host we can use it to exploit other hosts on the same internal network
- Meterpreter provides the ability to add a network route to the internal network's subnet and scan other systems

## Demonstration

```bash
# get meterpreter session first
m> ipconfig
# add route
# ex: 10.10.10.0/24
m> run autoroute -s <ip>/<net_range>
> use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
> set PORTS 1-1000
> run
# forward port to do service version enumeration
m> portfwd add -l <local_port> -p <target_port> -r <target_ip>
> db_nmap -sS -sV -p <local_port> localhost
```
