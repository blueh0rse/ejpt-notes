# Vulnerability Scanning with MSF

- Process of scanning a target for vulns and check the exploitability

## Demonstration

- Service versions are very important

```bash
> workspace -a MS3
> db_nmap -sS -sV -O <ip>
> search type:exploit name:<Microsoft IIS>
```

How to be sure the module will work for our target?

Check the information.

```bash
> use <module>
> info
```

Also search with [[searchsploit]]:

```bash
searchsploit "Micosoft Windows SMB"
searchsploit "Micosoft Windows SMB" | grep -e "Metasploit"
```

Check for vulnerability:

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010
```

Command `analyze` can be used.
