# Exploiting SUID Binaries

- In addition to read, write, execute permissions Linux also provides users with specialized permissions. One of these is the Set Owner User ID (SUID)
- This permission provides users with the ability to execute a script with the permissions of the file owner
- It is typically used to provide unprivileged users with the ability to run specific scripts with elevated permissions.

- To exploit an SUID binary it needs to be owned by the root user

## Demonstration

```bash
# learn more about a file
file <file>
# find strings inside a file
strings <file>
# make a copy of bash
cp /bin/bash <file>
./<file>
```
