# Host Based Attacks

## What are System/Host Based Attacks?

- Attacks that are targeted toward a specific system or host (ex: Windows or Linux)
- Network services are not the only attack vector that can be targeted during a pentest
- System/Host based attacks usually come in to play after you have gained access to a target network.
- Aer focused on exploiting vulnerability in the target OS
- Are much more specialized and require an understanding of the target OS.
- Involve exploiting misconfigurations and inherent vulnerabilities within the target OS
