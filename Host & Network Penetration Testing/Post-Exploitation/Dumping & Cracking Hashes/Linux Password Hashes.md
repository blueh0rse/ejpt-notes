# Linux Password Hashes

- All the accounts information are stored in the *passwd* file located in */etc/passwd*
- It can be accessed by any users
- The password hashes are stored in the /etc/shadow file
- It can only be read by the root user

- Different hashing algorithms can be used to hash passwords
	- $1 for MD5
	- $2 for blowfish
	- $5 for SHA-256
	- $6 for SHA-512

## Demonstration

```bash
cat /etc/shadow
> use post/linux/gather/hashdump
# save hash line in a hash.txt file
gzip -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
```

With john:

```bash
john --format=sha512crypt hash.txt --wordlist=rockyou.txt
```

With hashcat:

```bash
# 1800 = sha512
hashcat -a3 -m 1800 hash.txt rockyou.txt
```
