# Identifying Windows Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities

- In order to do so you must first privesc vulnerabilities on the target
- The process differs based on the type of target you gain access to
- It is quite tedious and time consuming so it's good to automate it
- [[PrivescCheck]] is a powershell script used to enumerate common Windows configuration issues

## Demonstration

```bash
> use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery
m> shell
> powershell -ep bypass -c ". .\PrivescCheck.ps1; Invoke-PrivescCheck"
```
