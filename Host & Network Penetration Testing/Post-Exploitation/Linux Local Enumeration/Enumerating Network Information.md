# Enumerating Network Information

- What are we looking for?
	- Current IP address & network adapter
	- Internal networks
	- TCP/UDP services running and their ports
	- Other hosts on the network

## Demonstration

```bash
m> ifconfig
m> netstat
m> route
m> shell
/bin/bash -i
$ ip add
$ cat /etc/networks
$ cat /etc/hostname
$ cat /etc/hosts
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
$ arp
```
