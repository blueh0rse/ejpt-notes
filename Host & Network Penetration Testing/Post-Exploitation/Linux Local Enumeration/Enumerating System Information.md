# Enumerating System Information

- Enumerating system information is useful as it gives us an idea of what we can do and what type of exploit we can run
- What are we looking for?
	- Hostname
	- Distribution & release version
	- Kernel version & architecture
	- CPU information
	- Disk information & mounted drives
	- Installed packages/software

## Demonstration

```bash
# get meterpreter session...
m> shell
$ hostname
$ cat /etc/issue
$ cat /etc/*release
$ uname -a
$ env
$ lscpu
$ df -h
$ lsblk | grep sd
$ dpkg -l
```
