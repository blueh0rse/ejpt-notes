# Setting up a Web Server with Python

- You need to transfer files to the target system
- Sometimes you don't have access to the target via a Meterpreter session
	- You will need to use the built in OS utilities
- 2 step approach:
	- Host the files you want to transfer
	- Download the files you need
- Python comes with a builtin module know as:
	- `SimpleHTTPServer` for python2
	- `http.server` for python3

## Demonstration

```bash
# python2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
# python 3
python3 -m http.server 80
```
