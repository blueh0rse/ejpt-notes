# Enumerating System Information

- Always important to learn more about the system
- What are we looking for?
	- Hostname
	- OS name
	- OS build & Service Pack
	- OS Architecture
	- Installed updates/hotfixes

## Demonstration

```bash
# meterpreter session
> getuid
> sysinfo
> shell
>hostname
>systeminfo
>wmic qfe get Caption,Decription,HotfixID,InstalledOn
m> cat C:\eula.txt
```
