# Clearing Tracks

- Exploitation and Post Exploitation phases of a pentest involves actively engaging with target systems and the data that is stored
- You may be required to clear/undo any changes you have made to the target systems based on the guidelines specified in the rules of engagement
- Any transferred files have to be removed
- Good practice is to save everything in the `C:\Temp` or `/tmp` directory

- MSF is notorious for generating and storing artifacts on the target when using exploit or post modules
- Some modules provide instructions regarding where the artifacts are stored and how they can be removed
- In the context of Windows deleting the Windows Event Log has to be avoided as it stores a lot of important data for the client

## Demonstration

Some modules generates artefacts and can even create resource script to automate the removing. To execute it and clear your tracks:

```bash
m> resource <resource_script>
```
