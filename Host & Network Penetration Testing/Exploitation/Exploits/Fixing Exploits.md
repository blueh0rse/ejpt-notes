# Fixing Exploits

## Demonstration

1. Identify a vulnerable service
2. Identify a relevant exploit to run against it
3. Adapt the exploit code to fit our needs

Usually it is about modifying the target/local ip and the port(s) associated.

Sometimes we need to move the payload to the target:

```bash
# serve exploit
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
# run listener
$ nc -lvnp 1234
```
