# Cross Compiling Exploits

- In certain cases exploit code will be developed in C/C++/C#
- It needs to be compiled to a PE or a binary
- Cross-Compiling is the process of compiling code for another platform than the one performing the compilation

- Python can be run in both Linux and Windows
- C needs to be compiled for a specific platform to be run

## Demonstration

- Mingw needs to be installed to compile code for Windows

- cross compilation from Linux to Windows:

```bash
$ i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 9303.c -o exploit
```
