# Obfuscating PowerShell Code

- Process of concealing something important
- Reorganizes code in order to make it harder to analyze or reverse engineer
- Pentesters work very often with PowerShell
- Most AV solution will immediately flag it as malicious

- We will use [[Invoke-Obfuscation]]:

## Demonstration

```bash
# clone repository ...
# use powershell reverse shell from payloadallthethings
# install powershell
$ sudo apt install powershell
$ pwsh
> Import-Module ./Invoke-Obfuscation.ps1
> Invoke-Obfuscation
# paste reverse in a shell.ps1
> SET SCRIPTPATH shell.ps1
> ENCODING
> 1
> SET SCRIPTPATH shell.ps1
> BACK
> AST
> ALL
> 1
# save obfuscated output
```
