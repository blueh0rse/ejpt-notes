# Introduction to Information Gathering

## What is Information Gathering?

- Information gathering is the ==first step of any penetration test== and involves gathering or collecting information about an individual, company, website or system that you are targeting.

- The more information you have on your target, the more successful you will be during the latter stages of a penetration test.

- Information gathering is typically broken down into two types:
	- **Passive: Involves gathering as much information as possible without actively engaging with the target.
	- **Active:** Involves gathering as much information as possible by actively engaging with the target system. (You will require authorization in order to perform active information gathering)

## What Information Are We Looking For?

- Passive Information Gathering
	- ==IP addresses== & DNS information
	- ==Domain names== and domain ownership information
	- ==Email addresses== and social media profiles
	- ==Web technologies== being used on target sites
	- ==Subdomains==
- Active Information Gathering
	- Discovering ==open ports== on target systems
	- Learning about the ==internal infrastructure== of a target network/organization
	- Enumerating information from target systems
